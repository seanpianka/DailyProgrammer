# DailyProgrammer
My [r/DailyProgrammer](reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) solutions!

## What and Why
Dailyprogrammer is about challenging programmers of all skill level with weekly programming challenges. 3 challenges a week are posted at increasing difficulty. Solutions are peer reviewed and redditors can ask for the community for feedback and comments.

Dailyprogrammer is for anyone who wants to improve or practice programming. There is no restriction to who can use this subreddit.

## Background
The typical posting of challenges occur on or near the following days.

Mon [Easy]
Wed [Intermediate]
Fri [Hard]

It is important to keep in mind a few basic considerations of the difficulty. The difficulty of a challenge is rated roughly for the required knowledge, theory and effort required to complete. There does not exist a simple or easy measure of rating challenges. What might seem [Hard] might turn out to be [Easy] for some redditors while some [Easy] might be [Hard] for other redditors.

Challenges are developed from ideas posted on [/r/DailyProgrammer_ideas](reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas) and ideas from the moderator team.
